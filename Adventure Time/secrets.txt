[0200 hours][upper stairs]
I was looking for my arch nemesis Peace Master, 
but instead I saw that cowering little puppet from the Ice King.....gunter.
What was he up to, I don't know.
But I saw him sneaking in the secret lab of Princess Bubblegum.
To be able to see what he was doing I used my spell 'the evil eye' and saw him.
He was hacking the secret laptop with something small like a duck of rubber.
I had to look closely, but I think I saw him type in something.
It was unclear, but it was something like 'The Ice King s????'.
The last 4 letters where a blur.

Should I tell princess Bubblegum or see how this all plays out?
I don't know.......
